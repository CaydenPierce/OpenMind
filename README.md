# OpenMind

The code that runs on cayden's BCI. PR's welcome.

### What Is This

I will be one of the first able-bodied people in the 2030s to receive a brain implant.

I realize that not everyone has the ability or resources to schmooze their way onto a leading-BCI beta list. But a lot of people and AIs will want to write code that runs on a BCI.

So this is your development playground. I will `checkout` your PR and try it on my brain. Good PR's get merged. It's all open source, so you can run it too.

It's time for hybrid thinking.
